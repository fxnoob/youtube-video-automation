>Youtube news video maker creates videos from scraping text and pictures from internet and convert text to audio then make a video from images after that merges the audio and video to upload it on Youtube so that user could earn money from Adsense.


# Consensus
  - Scrape the content from internet (text and images , tags too if possible)(PHP)
  - convert the text to audio (google tts script)(PERL,BASH)
  - Merge audio and to video(Slides of photos) to make a complete video to watch(FFMPEG,BASH)
  - Upload it to youtube (youtube data v3 apis)(PHP)

# New Features!

### Tech

 Youtube news video maker uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [php] -CLI 
* [Sublime Editor] - awesome text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [BASH] - CLI
* [Perl] -Google tts
* [MYSQL] - db 

# What I have learned from this project(Adesense Advice)
```sh
>1.Intro video should be added because everybody is already doing scraping and uploading to the youtube so content could be marked as copied content.
>2. Dont upload much videos per day (No video spam)
```
